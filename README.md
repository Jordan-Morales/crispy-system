#### Original Goal:
>I'm thinking if I do the tea one, It has a timer built in for the different teas, you >can select a list of favorite teas, you can share you list public or keep private, >each tea has an info page that tells you about it and where it's from (google maps >fits in here), and finally a special feature would be a green tea preparation >course that gives you a little badge next to your user name and says you learned how >to prep the green tea traditionally.
