I'm thinking if I do the tea one, It has a timer built in for the different teas, you can select a list of favourite teas, you can share you list public or keep private, each tea has an info page that tells you about it and where it's from (google maps fits in here), annnnd finally a special feature would be a green tea preperation course that gives you a little badge next to your user name and says you learned how to prep the green tea traditionally. -->
